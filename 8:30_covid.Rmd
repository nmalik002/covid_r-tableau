## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(readxl)
library(nnet)
library(caTools)
df = read.csv('covid-08-11-2020.csv')
df$mentalHealthImpact <- as.factor(df$mentalHealthImpact)
df$X.age <- as.factor(df$X.age)

# df$disorientation + df$fatigue+df$bodyAche 
 cols = c("diarrhea","difficultyBreathing","headAche","persistentCough", "temperature",
"lossOfSmell","soreThroat")

df$symptom_score <- rowSums(df[,cols])
table(df$symptom_score)

df$symptom <- ifelse(df$symptom_score>=1, 1,0)
table(df$symptom)

#fixing classification imbalance issue



#split data
set.seed(88)


#trial 2 
df$real_symp <- ifelse(df$noSymptoms == 0, 1,0)

simp <- which(df$real_symp == 1)
no_simp <- which(df$real_symp == 0)

pick_nosimp<- sample(simp, 3856)
pick_simp <- sample(no_simp,5000)

df2 <- df[c(pick_simp,pick_nosimp), ]
set.seed(88)
spl <- sample.split(df2$noSymptom, SplitRatio=0.7)
covid_train <- df2[spl,]
covid_test <- df2[!spl,]

covid.glm <- glm(symptom ~ exposureLevel + faceCovering + gender + healthIssues + householdHeadcount + leftHomeTimes + leftForExercise + leftForOther + leftForWork  , data = covid_train, family = "binomial" )
summary(covid.glm)
df
covid_predict = predict(covid.glm, newdata = covid_test, type = "response")
covid.predict

confMat = table(covid_test1$real_symp, covid_predict >= .5)
accuracy_glm = sum(diag(confMat))/nrow(covid_test)
accuracy_glm


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
